o Report the results of the timing experiment in sort.c. Which was faster, SelectionSort() or InsertionSort()? Explain why. Was this what you expected? How does performance compare on your laptop vs your Nucleo?

In my laptop SelectionSort() took 23 cycles and 0.000023 ms to complete while InsertionSort() took 12 cycles to complete and 0.000012 ms to complete so my InsertionSort() was faster. This is because SelectionSort makes more comparisons than InsertionSort so like SelectionSort will compare every single item in the list to check the least item in the list whereas Insertion Sort does not have to do that it only assigns it to the correct position so there fewer steps in it. Essentially InsertionSort() only makes the comparisons that are needed while SelectionSort() makes more than what is needed.  These are the results I expected because according to the lab manual InsertionSort() is faster than SelectionSort() so it proved the claim. In my nucleo both functions seem to be more slower than on my laptop as the result on InsertionSort took 160 cycles and 0.160000 ms to complete while my result on SelectionSort() took 257 cycles and 0.2570000 ms to complete, so my InsertionSort() was faster on my Nucleo again. 

o In the next section you should provide a summary of the lab in your own words. Highlight what you thought were the important aspects of the lab. If these differ from how the lab manual presents things, make a note of that. 
The most important aspects of the lab were probably understanding the difference in logic between SelectionSort() and InsertionSort() so that a pseudocode can be created for it so code can be written for it. Also it is very important that two functions LinkedListGetFirst and LinkedListGetLast work correctly.

o The following section should describe your approach to the lab. What was your general approach to the lab? Did you read the manual first or what were your first steps? What went wrong as you worked through it? What worked well? How would you approach this lab differently if you were to do it again? How did you work with other students in the class and what did you find helpful/unhelpful? 

My general approach on this lab was to start off by doing the LinkedList.c file first because these are the functions I would use in my sort.c file and so I implemented this by creating pseudocode so I can have clear logic before diving into my code. Then I used the LinkedListTest.c file to test each of my functions and their edge cases before I move onto my next steps. After going through debugging for a few hours, then I went to sort.c and this part was not too difficult because I was able to use the functions from the LinkedList.c file to make my code more efficient and easier to do. I read the manual first and my first steps were to create pseudocode for each of my functions in the LinkedList.c file. My LinkedListRemove I feel was what went as I worked through it like I felt my test cases were not properly checking to see if my code was working properly. My insertion and sorting functions in my sort.c file worked well. I would approach this lab differently by the fact that I would read more of the end of the file because I noticed there was more information on what I should test and then I will start my lab so I can remember what I should be thinking about as I implement my code. I worked with the TA’s from the lab section on this lab and I found it helpful to print out my expected and actual results though each of my test cases to make sure my code was working efficiently and all my tests were actually passing. 

o The final section should describe the results of you implementing the lab. How did it end up finally? How many hours did you end up spending on it? What did you like about it? What did you dislike? Was this a worthwhile lab? Do you have any suggestions for altering it to make it better? What were the hardest parts of it? Did the points distribution for the grading seem appropriate? Did the lab manual cover the material in enough detail to start you off? Did examples or discussions during class help you understand this lab or would more teaching on the concepts in this lab help?

My lab ended up passing all the tests and all functions ran successfully on my Nucleo and on my laptop. I spent about 16 hours in this lab. I really enjoyed implementing the LinkedList functions because most of them were very small so it made it easier to understand how the logic behind LinkedList worked. I disliked making test cases because that leads me to new bugs within my code and I have to go back and check it and that can take a while sometimes to fix especially if you are new to coding. This lab was worthwhile because it teaches a student about the new concepts like doubly-linked lists, memory allocation sorting, pointers, and algorithmic analysis since it has first work with smaller functions and then two bigger functions but once you work with those smaller functions then working with the two bigger function in the sort.c file makes it harder. I feel like it would be better to explain which functions or like a hint of which functions from the LinkedList file we should or should not use when working out functions in sort.c file because I was confused on why we had so many functions given when I only used a few. The hardest part was probably implementing the InsertionSort() and SelectionSort() functions. The points distribution for the grading seems appropriate and fair and the lab manual did cover material in enough detail to start me off. The examples and discussion during class did help me understand this lab and I do think more teaching of these concepts in this lab would not hurt because the more I learn about this the less self learning I have to do on my own, but I think sufficient information was given for me to figure it out for the most part.
